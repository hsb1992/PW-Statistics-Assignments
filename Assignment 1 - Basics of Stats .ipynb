    "# and provide examples of each. Discuss nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Data can be divided into 2  types:\n",
    "# 1. Qualitative type \n",
    "# 2. Quantitative type\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Qualitative Data\n",
    "# Qualitative data is all about descriptions and characteristics that can't be measured \n",
    "# with numbers. It's about qualities and details rather than quantities. For example, \n",
    "# the colors of cars in a parking lot (red, blue, black) is the example of qualitative data. \n",
    "# This type of data is usually sorted into nominal and ordinal scales based on \n",
    "# how it can be categorized.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Quantitative Data\n",
    "# On the other hand, quantitative data is all about numbers and measurements. \n",
    "# It represents quantities or amounts that can be measured. \n",
    "# For instance, the height of individuals (170 cm, 180 cm, 160 cm), \n",
    "# the number of students in a class (20, 25, 30), and \n",
    "# temperature readings (30°C, 25°C, 40°C) are all examples of quantitative data. \n",
    "# This type of data can be classified into interval and ratio scales based on its \n",
    "# characteristics and how it can be compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Nominal Scale (Qualitative)\n",
    "# Definition: The nominal scale sorts data into separate categories that don’t have any specific order.\n",
    "# Characteristics: The categories are distinct and can’t be ranked.\n",
    "# Examples of Nominal Data:\n",
    "# - Gender: Male, Female, Non-binary.\n",
    "# - Blood type: A, B, AB, O.\n",
    "# - Marital status: Single, Married, Divorced.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Ordinal Scale (Qualitative)\n",
    "# Definition: The ordinal scale organizes data into categories that can be ranked, but the gaps between the ranks aren’t necessarily equal.\n",
    "# Characteristics: There’s a clear ranking, but you can’t measure the exact differences between the values.\n",
    "# Examples of Ordinal Data:\n",
    "# - Movie ratings: Excellent, Good, Average, Poor.\n",
    "# - Class rankings: 1st, 2nd, 3rd.\n",
    "# - Socioeconomic status: Low, Middle, High.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Interval Scale (Quantitative)\n",
    "# Definition: The interval scale assesses quantitative data with equal spacing between values, but it lacks a true zero point (zero doesn’t mean there’s no quantity).\n",
    "# Characteristics: You can compare differences, but not ratios.\n",
    "# Examples of Interval Data:\n",
    "# - Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit: 20°C, 30°C, 40°C (0°C doesn’t mean \"no temperature\").\n",
    "# - Calendar years: 1990, 2000, 2010 (year 0 doesn’t indicate the \"absence of time\").\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Ratio Scale (Quantitative)\n",
    "# Definition: The ratio scale evaluates quantitative data with equal intervals and a true zero point (zero indicates the absence of the quantity).\n",
    "# Characteristics: You can compare both differences and ratios since zero has a real meaning.\n",
    "# Examples of Ratio Data:\n",
    "# - Weight: 60 kg, 80 kg (0 kg means no weight).\n",
    "# - Height: 150 cm, 175 cm (0 cm means no height).\n",

    "\n",
    "# 1. Mean  \n",
    "# Definition: Commonly known as the \"average,\" the mean is calculated by adding all the values\n",
    "# in a dataset and dividing by the total number of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "# When to Use the Mean:  \n",
    "# - Symmetrical data: Ideal for datasets that are evenly distributed without \n",

    "# a = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5\n",

    "\n",
    "# When to Use the Median:  \n",
    "# - Skewed distributions: The median is advantageous for skewed data or datasets with extreme \n",

    "# - Ordinal data: It is applicable for ordinal-level data where values can be ranked, \n",

    "# A data set can be classified as having no mode, a single mode (unimodal), or \n",
    "# multiple modes (bimodal or multimodal).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: In the data set 10, 20, 20, 30, 40, the mode is 20 because it appears twice.\n",

    "# In the data set 10, 10, 20, 20, 30, 30, there are three modes: 10, 20, and 30.\n",

    "# When to Use the Mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Categorical data: The mode serves as the most effective measure of central tendency for \n",
    "# nominal data (for instance, identifying the most popular color or category).\n",
    "# - Multimodal distributions: When the data exhibits more than one peak or cluster of \n",
    "# frequently occurring values, the mode can highlight several common points.\n",
    "# Example: In a class survey where students select their favorite color, if 10 students \n",
    "# pick blue, 5 choose green, and 3 opt for red, the mode is blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "# When NOT to Use the Mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Quantitative data with no frequent values: If all values are distinct or nearly distinct, \n",

    "# Positive Skewness (Right-Skewed Distribution):  \n",
    "\n",

    "# In a left-skewed distribution, the tail on the left (lower values) is longer than the tail \n",

    "# the mean to the left. In this type of distribution, the order is Mean < Median < Mode. For\n",

    "# Effect on Data Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Positive skewness: Most data points are lower, but there are some high extreme values. \n",
    "# This is crucial for interpreting income, prices, or test scores, where a few high figures \n",
    "# can skew the mean.\n",
    "# Negative skewness: Most data points are higher, with a few extreme low values. This can \n",

    "\n",
    "# Understanding Data Distribution and Outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Skewed distributions often include outliers that can significantly impact the mean. Skewness\n",

    "# In positively skewed distributions, analysts should be careful when interpreting the mean, \n",
